```{r setup, include=FALSE}
# Everything in this chunk is R code. 
# You are not expected to understand or edit this yet. 
# We will talk about what this does in a later class, with a little preview in part 2.
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE) 
```

Reminders:

-   You do not need to memorize Markdown syntax.
-   You are expected to look things up using:
    -   RStudio’s Markdown Help
    -   Online documentation or examples
-   Click Knit as you go to check that your document still renders correctly.
-   Commit at the end, but consider committing as you go as well.

# Part 1: Markdown Practice

**Do not skip reading this instruction** Create a new section at the end of this section named "Your work here". In that section, complete the tasks below:

-   Make a *subsection* called Wise Words.
-   Put your favorite quote in a block quote.
-   Add a working, clickable link to a website that provides more information about that quote.
-   Make another *subsection* called "I recommend", and add some information about your favorite author or musician:
    -   A *subsubheading* with the name of the artist or author;\
    -   An example of their writing or lyrics (formatted in a *block of text*);\
    -   A *list* of things they have written or performed (remember to use the formatting markup for a list!), with any of the titles/names in bold.

# Part 2: Code Chunks

```{r echo=TRUE}
2 + 2
```

# Your Work Here

## Wise words

> "Everyday is a chance to be better" [link](https://quotesilove.com/everyday-is-a-new-chance-quotes/)

### I recommend

#### Jermaine Lamarr Cole

He is a musician and artist that is well versatile for this thoughtful lyrics and wordplay that focuses on personal growth.

##### His most popular song includes:

-   **Love Yourz**
-   **No Role Modelz**
-   **Middle Child**
-   **Power Trip**

Complete the following steps:

-   Knit the document and observe what appears in the output.
-   Change the chunk option echo=TRUE to echo=FALSE.
-   Knit the document again.
-   Finally, write 2–3 sentences answering the following questions:
    -   What changed between the two outputs?

    -   Did the calculation still run when the code was hidden?

    -   Why might someone want to hide code in a report?

    -   Why might someone want to show code in a report?

When echo=TRUE, the Knitted output shows both the R code and the result, but when echo=FALSE, the code itself is hidden and only the result shows. Yes, the calculation still ran even when the code was hidden. someone might want to hide code in a report probably to make it look cleaner and easier to read. While, showing the code can be useful for transparency, learning, or so others can see exactly how the result was found.

# Part 3: A small R-in-markdown preview

-   Create a subsection within this section called About this document.
-   Write 2–3 sentences describing what this document is and what it produces.
-   Include one value generated by inline R code.

`r 78+27`

> To include inline code, use this weird little `r 2+2` pattern, putting the code where I have 2+2 (which is code!) You can use the function `Sys.Date()`, which would be added like this `r Sys.Date()` but you can do something else if you want. (Look at the knit html to see what this does.)

# About this Document

This is an R Markdown document for my Data Science class. It shows how to combine text, lists, quotes, and R code in one report. Today’s date is `r Sys.Date()`.

# Submitting Instructions

When you are finished:

-   Knit the document so that it produces an html file.
-   Stage, commit, and push:
    -   The updated `.rmd` file
    -   The generated `.html` file
-   Submit the GitHub link to the assignment on Canvas.
